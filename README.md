## Observations

- Does not work with **Homebrews**
- Does not work with **Subsets**
- It is necessary to manually create the file with the links
- The other files will be created automatically
- The name of the file with the links **must be exactly the same** as the one in **storedLinks**

## üéØ Future Goals

- Transform this project into a interface friendly application for common users.

- Get Homebrews.

## üìå How it Works

1. **Setup**:
   - Enter your **username and password**
   - Provide the **direct link** to your Want to Play list **with filters**
   - Configure the `.txt` files
   - Set `true` if they are arcade games
   - `npm run start`

2. **Game Hash Collection**:
   - The script enters the **RA website**
   - Passes the **Captcha**
   - Logs in with your account
   - Enters your **Want to Play** list (using the link you provided)
   - Scans **all games** across all pages
   - Accesses the **Supported Game File** section for each game
   - Collects the **hash name** of each game
   - Outputs to both the **console** and **games.txt**

   If a game has no hash, you‚Äôll see:

   - ‚ö†Ô∏è `Game with no registered hashes, skipping: game link without hash`
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è `No region-valid games found on this page: game link without hash`

3. **Link Comparison**:
   - Compares collected hashes with the links stored in **gamelinks.txt** (which is not provided in this project)
   - Shows in the console:
     - **Percentage of games found**
     - **Which games were not found**

4. **Output**:
   - Inserts the found links into:
     - **LinksforDownload.txt**
     - **index.html**

5. **Download Process**:
   - Open `index.html` using **Live Server**
   - Copy the **running link**
   - Open **JDownloader 2**
   - Go to the **Link Grabber** tab
   - Click **Add New Links**, and paste the link (it will auto-paste if possible)
   - Set your **download folder**
   - Start downloading!

‚úÖ That‚Äôs it! Happy downloading.
